<p>
  Your customers are complaning and you are not sure why. You keep implementing new ideas, yet people stop doing business with you anyway. You wish you could know why and make up to it before it's too late.
</p>

<p>
  You don't have to lose sight of your customers. Talk to My Customers is here to help you get back into the game. If you're curious about how we can help you, please read on.

<h2>You want to talk to your customers</h2>

<p>
  You are running a successful business and there was a time when your customer base was big enough that you were in touch with your customers almost every day. You used to <em>know</em> almost all of them. You were able to ask them direct questions and share thoughts. In return they would usually give their honest opinions about things, right there. Together you used to shape your business, for the best. Today you have hundreds or thousands of customers and perhaps more than one product. Your finances are just fine <em>obviously</em>, but things with your customers don't feel like going in the right direction — it's surprisingly difficult to talk to them.
</p>

<p>
  There are not enough hands in your company to count number of customers you have, so it's not even an option remembering their names anymore. You have all the user data in the world to analyze and predict the future using some <i>high-tech-foo</i>, but you've lost that <strong>human factor</strong> that has got you here in the first place. Work isn't fun anymore. You've got to this point by serving your customers with great work, but now it feels more like shipping out stuff and see if there is anybody out there to grab them.

<h2>Welcome to Talk to My Customers</h2>

<p>
  Talk to My Customers is a software tool that helps you ask anything to your customers at large. You won't have to make a list of anybody, you won't have to segment users. We will work hand-to-hand with you to connect you with your customers.
</p>

<p>
  Every time you will want to talk to you customers...
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>You'll learn how your customers feel about your business, the work, the culture, etc.</strong> With a message such as... "I honestly want to know what's bugging you about my product, talk to me.", you'll be able to address issues before they turn into bigger problems.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>You'll learn what your customers are experiencing in real time.</strong> Shoot out the message... "Hey! How's everyone doing right now? I've got a couple of hours to dedicate to any questions anyone has about the product right now they're not happy with, things you love... talk to me, just talk to me." and you will be to chat one-to-one.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>You'll learn more about your customers as people.</strong> You can go totally informal like... "Hey! What's going on today? Anything interesting is happening in your life? I'd like to know." This could be a recent movie or a celebrating event. The small connections will bring everyone a little closer together.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>What will you get.</h2>

<h3>A giant plain text box.</h3>

<img src="" alt="" />

<p>
  You will go to this box on the screen and type in whatever it is, and hit send. Your message will go to all of your customers. This is <em>not</em> an email app, because you don't have all your customers in Gmail perhaps and you don't want to deal with all the replies inside of your inbox. You just want to talk to your customers, it's all you care about.
</p>

<h3>A check box to let your customers know you've got a couple of hours right now!</h3>

<img src="" alt="" />

<p>
  Most of the time you will send your message out and wait for replies from your customers to pile up, to read them at once. Other times however, you will have a couple of hours to talk to your customers in <em>real time</em>. When this is true, people will be able to come in and chat with you in the most simplest way possible, without having to sign up, verify their email addresses, or anything — any unnecesssary steps are taken away so you can talk to your customers <em>right now</em>.
</p>

<h3>A summary of all of the messages you receive over time that are easy to reply.</h3>

<img src="" alt="" />

<p>
  Everyday you will receive a summary of all of the replies you received in plain text. Our software will strip out all of the irrelavant pieces of text and send you a nicely formatted, <strong>highly actionable</strong> summary message. You will be able to read ongoing conversations, as well as new ones, and reply directly within your email client. This means no fancy HTML templates or hundreds of poorly formatted unread emails in your inbox.
